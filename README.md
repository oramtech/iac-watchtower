# iac-watchtower

This repo is designed to work with the iac-watchtower in the oramtech organization in Terraform Cloud. The repo was generated from [bootstrap-terraform-cloud](https://github.com/oramtech/bootstrap-terraform-cloud)

To use, simply add additional resources to create docker containers, cloudflare tunnels, cloudflare access applications, aws resources, etc. You can use the [IAC-Homarr repo](https://github.com/oramtech/iac-homarr) as an example.

## Usage

Codespaces support is built in! So from a CodeSpace terminal you can run the standard terraform validate/plan/apply workflow.
